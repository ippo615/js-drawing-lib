js-drawing-lib
==============

A library for drawing stuff in a web-browser.

Check out http://ippo615.github.com/js-drawing-lib/
to see some examples and to experiment with the library.

To use it just include it in your webpage:

If you want to support internet explorer you also need to
include excanvas:

	<!--[if lt IE 9]>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="./excanvas.compiled.js"></script>
	<![endif]-->
	<script type="text/javascript" src="./gfx.js"></script>
